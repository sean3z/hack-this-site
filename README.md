## PHPBB3 Mod: Hack this Site

Came across [this project from 2007](https://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=70&t=718155) while searching an old harddrive and thought I would (finally) share. I haven't touched this since then so be prepared for some whacky code. I honestly have no idea whether this still works with phpBB3 or not.

This phpBB3 mod is direct port of [hackthissite.org](http://hackthissite.org). Hack this Site! is a legal and safe network security resource where users test their hacking skills on various challenges and learn about hacking and network security risks. This phpBB3 mod uses the [Simple_Points_System](http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=70&t=543803) provided by Ganon_master.
